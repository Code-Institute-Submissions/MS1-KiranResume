  ## UX

 ### **User Stories**

 1. Recruiters want to see past work experience of the client.
 2. Recruiters want to see educational qualification of the client.
 3. Recruiters want to know what the employee thinks about herself/himself.
 4. They want to easily navigate through the site and get pdf of cv, if they want.

 ### **5 Planes**---

### **Strategy**
  I wanted a simple website for Recruiters and Employers. Which should be easy to navigate and get information.

### **Scope**
  I wanted to add my past work experiences and present ongoing course details on the site.

### **Structure**
 I wanted the visitor of the site to easily get to see the live URL of my projects, 
 Easily connect to my GitHub and LinkedIn. and if they want they can download the pdf version of my CV also.

### **Skeleton**
 *Wireframes*
 Wireframe, which was made in the initial stage of product development is a little different from the final product.
During the development, I thought that it would be wise to add one profile image on the home page.
 So that everybody will know who they are talking about. I thought of adding code institute past project links and live URLs also.
  So that the recruiters can get a clear picture of my skill.
