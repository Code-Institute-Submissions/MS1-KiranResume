  *Projects* done with Code Institute until now, A *blog* about me, *CV PDF* in the resume section, and *Contact* details.

  ## **UX**

 ### **User Stories**
 
  #### The main users of this site are going to be potential employers and recruiters.  


 1. Recruiters want to easily navigate through the site 
 2. Recruiters want to see the past work experience of the client and what is He/She doing in present.
 3. Recruiters want to see the educational qualification of the client. They want to be sure if the applicant is capable of the job.
 4. Recruiters want to know what the employee thinks about herself/himself and how does He/She look.
 5. Recruiters want to get a pdf of cv if they like the profile.
 6. As a recruiter, If I want to contact the applicant, how many ways are there to contact her/him. For example, can I make a telephone call or Can I send an 
 email immediately or can I send a message on any social network sites, such as Linkedin or Twitter.
 7. Recruiters want to know how eagerly applicants want this job and how He/She is upscaling themselves to get this.
 8. If recruiters like the profile, Is there any way to tell the applicant about the project for which they are considering that profile.

 ### **5 Planes**---

### **Strategy**
  I wanted a simple website for Recruiters and Employers. Which should be easy to navigate and get information.

### **Scope**
  I wanted to add my past work experiences and present ongoing course details on the site. I wanted to add my contact details and some personal information also.

### **Structure**
 I wanted a Navbar that has my **brand image** and **menu links** which can be used to go to the project section, about section, and contact section.
 I wanted the visitor of the site to easily navigate through the site, get my **Personal information**, get to see my **Educational background** and **Work experience** 
 in a simple format. If they want they can easily connect to my **GitHub** and **LinkedIn**. and download the pdf version of my **CV** also. When someone visits the site 
 the first thing they see should be personal information so that they connect with the applicant, then educational qualification should come, followed by contact details and form.

### **Skeleton**

 **Wireframe**, which was made in the initial stage of product development is a little different from the final product.
During the development, I thought that it would be wise to add one profile image on the home page.
 So that everybody will know who they are talking about. I thought of adding code institute past project links and live URLs also.
  So that the recruiters can get a clear picture of my skill. So, I made one more wireframe with additional features and 
with a view of tablet size device also.

*The initial wireframe can be seen here*  [wireframe](assets/docs/wireframe.pdf)

*The final wireframe can be seen here*  [final wireframe]()

### **Surface**
 The background color is kept **Beige** to give a calm and smooth feeling. The font used was **"Raleway"** imported from google fonts. The font color was decided to keep **black** 
 for the entire page and **dark orange** for the headings. The project is a single-page site with 3-page length. It was decided to keep it this way for easy navigation for mobile viewers.
 The links were provided to get a better idea about the projects, Github repositories and Linkedin profile.
