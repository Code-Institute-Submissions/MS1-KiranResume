 A resume website for myself, **Kiran Satyarthy**. I am an Engineer and currently pursuing a Full-Stack development diploma from **Code Institute**. 
 This is a single-page website with a 3-page length. This website is made for Recruiters and Employers. This website features my *Personal Information*, *Profile Picture*,
  *Projects* done with Code Institute until now, A *blog* about me, *CV PDF* in the resume section, and *Contact* details.

  ## **UX**

 ### **User Stories**

 1. Recruiters want to see the past work experience of the client.
 2. Recruiters want to see the educational qualification of the client.
 3. Recruiters want to know what the employee thinks about herself/himself.
 4. They want to easily navigate through the site and get a pdf of cv if they want.

 ### **5 Planes**---

### **Strategy**
  I wanted a simple website for Recruiters and Employers. Which should be easy to navigate and get information.

### **Scope**
  I wanted to add my past work experiences and present ongoing course details on the site.

### **Structure**
 I wanted the visitor of the site to easily get to see the live URL of my projects, 
 Easily connect to my GitHub and LinkedIn. and if they want they can download the pdf version of my CV also.

### **Skeleton**
 *Wireframes*
 Wireframe, which was made in the initial stage of product development is a little different from the final product.
During the development, I thought that it would be wise to add one profile image on the home page.
 So that everybody will know who they are talking about. I thought of adding code institute past project links and live URLs also.
  So that the recruiters can get a clear picture of my skill.

### *Manual Testing of all elements and functionality of every page.*---
* **Navigation Bar**
    
    The Navigation bar was tested for its links and for its responsiveness. The links were working properly and PDF is opening in a different window.
    The navbar is responsive also for every device. But in the mobile view, it does not collapse back after clicking on a link. This can be viewed as an **open bug** in the navbar.

    which is tested and it's found that it is  working fine. Each **title name** of the project is connected to **Github.io** and **Repl.it** repository of 
    that particular project. That link is also working fine. The section is responsive, Which is tested and verified.
* **About Me**

    All input sections of the forms are tested by putting some name and email and it is discovered that each section is giving a pop-up mentioning that it should be filled. 
    After filling every section button can be clicked and remain on the same page. all these features are working fine.
* **Footer**

    The footer is tested for its download link, and the pdf is opening on a different page. The social network icons were clicked and checked, they were opening social networks
    in a different window. All the features in this section were working fine as expected.

**Project Barrier**

 The initial CDN links which were attached in the head element was an older version and that started giving the error in Bootstrap. Especially in the navbar. This is later spotted by my Mentor 
 and was corrected after adding new CDN's from [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/)

The navbar is not collapsing back after clicking on it, in the mobile view.
